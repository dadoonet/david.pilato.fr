I have been missing you!
Indeed, last year, I have not been able to publish my anniversary blog post as I’m used to do every year since I joined Elastic 9 years ago.
That was for a technical reason actually. I was using a old and not updated blogging platform and it took me a looooong time before I was able to invest time to switch everything to Hugo.
So here we go! This year celebrates my 9 years anniversary at elastic but also a new blogging system.

What a ride! 10 employees to around 2000 now. As I imagined 8 years ago, I still think that Elasticsearch (the product) and elastic (the company) are successful.
Becoming a public company did not change a lot my daily activities.
I’m still on the road meeting/building the community, specifically in France and making sure people are sharing the same love that we have internally for the products we are building.
I’d like this year to focus this anniversary blog post on some items:

When I joined Elastic (formerly Elasticsearch) it was a startup with 10 employees + the founders. As one of those first employees I was invited (with #elkie and my wife) to the NYSE event where Elastic went listed as ESTC symbol.
Some of us there (Rashid, Karel, Myself, Igor, Costin, Luca, Clinton). Yeah. You are not probably used to see us wearing a suit! :)

This blog post is part of a series of 3:
Importing Bano dataset with Logstash Using Logstash to lookup for addresses in Bano index Using Logstash to enrich an existing dataset with Bano In the previous post, we described how we can transform a postal address to a normalized one with also the geo location point or transform a geo location point to a postal address.
Let’s say we have an existing dataset we want to enrich.

Importing Bano dataset with Logstash Using Logstash to lookup for addresses in Bano index Using Logstash to enrich an existing dataset with Bano In the previous post, we described how we indexed data coming from the BANO project so we now have indices containing all the french postal addresses.
Let’s see what we can do now with this dataset.
Searching for addresses Good. Can we use a search engine to search?

Importing Bano dataset with Logstash Using Logstash to lookup for addresses in Bano index Using Logstash to enrich an existing dataset with Bano I’m not really sure why, but I love the postal address use case. Often in my career I had to deal with that information. Very often the information is not well formatted so it’s hard to find the information you need when you have as an input a not so nice dataset.

What a milestone! Can you imagine how changed the company in the last 5 years? From 10 employees when I joined to more than 700 now!
If you want to read again my story, it’s there:
2013: Once upon a time… 2014: Once upon a time: a year later… 2015: Once upon a time: Make your dreams come true 2016: 3 years! Time flies! 2017: 4 years at elastic! Before speaking about what happened the last 5 years for me, let’s modify a bit the script I wrote last year.

2013: Once upon a time… 2014: Once upon a time: a year later… 2015: Once upon a time: Make your dreams come true 2016: 3 years! Time flies! This year, I will celebrate this by writing a new tutorial…

But sometimes, you may want to add existing plugins in your integration test cluster.
For example, you might want to use X-Pack to bring fantastic features such as:

Integration tests… How do you run them?
Often, you are tempted to run services you want to test from JUnit for example. In elasticsearch, you can extend ESIntegTestCase class which will start a cluster of a given number of nodes.
public class BanoPluginIntegrationTest extends ESIntegTestCase { public void testPluginIsLoaded() throws Exception { // Your code here } } But to be honest, the test you are running does not guarantee that you will have the same result in production.

Elasticsearch 5.0 switched to Gradle in October 2015.
You can obviously write a plugin using Gradle if you wish and you could benefit from all the goodies elasticsearch team wrote when it comes to integration tests and so on.
My colleague, Alexander Reelsen aka Spinscale on Twitter, wrote a super nice template if you wish to create an Ingest plugin for 5.

Integration tests… How do you run them?
Often, you are tempted to run services you want to test from JUnit for example. In elasticsearch, you can extend ESIntegTestCase class which will start a cluster of a given number of nodes.
public class BanoPluginIntegrationTest extends ESIntegTestCase { public void testPluginIsLoaded() throws Exception { // Your code here } } But to be honest, the test you are running does not guarantee that you will have the same result in production.

Elasticsearch 5.0 switched to Gradle in October 2015.
You can obviously write a plugin using Gradle if you wish and you could benefit from all the goodies elasticsearch team wrote when it comes to integration tests and so on.
My colleague, Alexander Reelsen aka Spinscale on Twitter, wrote a super nice template if you wish to create an Ingest plugin for 5.
