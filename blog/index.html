Becoming a public company did not change a lot my daily activities.
I’m still on the road meeting/building the community, specifically in France and making sure people are sharing the same love that we have internally for the products we are building.

Some of us there (Rashid, Karel, Myself, Igor, Costin, Luca, Clinton). Yeah. You are not probably used to see us wearing a suit! :)

Those tests launch a real elasticsearch cluster, then run some tests you write with JUnit or your favorite test framework then stop the cluster.
But sometimes, you may want to add existing plugins in your integration test cluster.
For example, you might want to use X-Pack to bring fantastic features such as:

Often, you are tempted to run services you want to test from JUnit for example. In elasticsearch, you can extend ESIntegTestCase class which will start a cluster of a given number of nodes.
public class BanoPluginIntegrationTest extends ESIntegTestCase { public void testPluginIsLoaded() throws Exception { // Your code here } } But to be honest, the test you are running does not guarantee that you will have the same result in production.<div class="text-tertiary-text not-prose mt-2 flex flex-row flex-wrap items-center"><div class="me-6 my-2"><i class="fas fa-calendar me-1"></i>

You can obviously write a plugin using Gradle if you wish and you could benefit from all the goodies elasticsearch team wrote when it comes to integration tests and so on.

2015 has been an uncommon year for me.
Not because Marty Mc Fly and Doc Emmett Brown finally arrived…
Not because, Han Solo, Leia and friends were finally back again…
But for technical and also personal reasons.
On a personal side, I had to deal with two major issues which cause some slow down in my professional activities.

I’m wondering if I can index the french lexique from Université de Savoie and find some funny things based on that…
Download french words wget http://www.lexique.org/listes/liste_mots.txt head -20 liste_mots.txt What do we have?
It’s a CSV file (tabulation as separator):

His need is to be able to search on a NAS for files when a user wants to restore a deleted file.
As you can imagine a search engine is super helpful when you have hundreds of millions files!<div class="text-tertiary-text not-prose mt-2 flex flex-row flex-wrap items-center"><div class="me-6 my-2"><i class="fas fa-calendar me-1"></i>

I have the same need today as I want to monitor Twitter when we run the elastic FR meetup (join us by the way if you are in France!).
Well, this recipe can be really simplified and actually I don’t want to waste my time anymore on building and managing elasticsearch and Kibana clusters anymore.
Let’s use a Found by elastic cluster instead.<div class="text-tertiary-text not-prose mt-2 flex flex-row flex-wrap items-center"><div class="me-6 my-2"><i class="fas fa-calendar me-1"></i>
