As I imagined 8 years ago, I still think that Elasticsearch (the product) and elastic (the company) are successful.</p><p>Becoming a public company did not change a lot my daily activities.</p><p>I&rsquo;m still on the road meeting/building the community, specifically in France and making sure people are sharing the same love that we have internally for the products we are building.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like this year to focus this anniversary blog post on some items:</p><ul><li>What became harder and harder?</li><li>What is my feedback on the 2019 policy?</li><li>Some highlights on 2019</li></ul><h2 id=the-hard-part>The hard part</h2><p>My job did not change that much. My main goals remain the same and are definitely aligned with the bottom-up company theme.</p><p>I want to make elastic community a real thing. And to do that, I basically meet people in real life.
It can be at meetups: I&rsquo;m organizing the <a href=https://www.meetup.com/ElasticFR>ElasticFR</a> user group and we have one meetup every 2 months. It has been so successful that we have already set all the next meetup dates and hosts until March 2021! Just fantastic&mldr; So fantastic that we decided to organize a meetup every 6 weeks from 2020 so we can add more hosts during a year.</p><p>I want people to download our stack, play with it, ideally make a POC (Proof Of Concept project) and why not go to production with it. If they are using the free basic version of the stack, that&rsquo;s perfectly fine. Of course, if they are using the <a href=https://cloud.elastic.co/>official hosted version</a> which makes their life easier, that&rsquo;s even better! But making users becoming paid customers is not my priority or my job. I just want people be aware of the nice things you can do with the stack.</p><p>But here comes the challenge. We have now a very big engineering team and let me tell you a secret: they are all amazing! They are constantly releasing new features, solving new use cases. And this becomes super tricky for me. I can&rsquo;t be an expert of everything. Search, Observability, Security&mldr; So many tools and solutions that you can&rsquo;t follow all the roadmaps&mldr;</p><p>That&rsquo;s the part I dislike when I&rsquo;m meeting people and they are asking me about a feature that I did not test myself. It&rsquo;s hard to give them the appropriate answer. So more often than before my answer is &ldquo;let me find the right contact&rdquo; or &ldquo;could you ask on <a href=https://discuss.elastic.co/>discuss.elastic.co</a>?&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=my-2019-travel-policy>My 2019 travel policy</h2><p>As <a href=https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2019-01-10-from-a-startup-to-a-listed-company-6-years-of-fun/>I wrote last year</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I want to try another model for this year. I&rsquo;m not sure yet how this will work but here is the deal. I want to travel up to one full week per month but only the same week, not including exceptions which might always happen, but let&rsquo;s say that&rsquo;s a general rule.</p></blockquote><p>I did that&mldr; And it went pretty well. I made some &ldquo;exceptions&rdquo; like I actually traveled 12 weeks last year but sometimes 2 weeks the same month and no travel during August.</p><p>As a consequence, I felt less exhausted at the end of 2019 although I still meet lot of people, engaged with the community and helped building new ones.</p><p>So I&rsquo;m going to continue that way for 2020.</p><h2 id=2019-highlights>2019 Highlights</h2><p>The first thing that happened to me on a personal level is that I was close to pass away in January. Got a medical unexpected issue but fortunately the doctors were able to fix everything. I spent 2 weeks at the hospital, had to rest 2 weeks more at home and it took me around 2 months to entirely recover. Good thing is that we discovered some weird things in my body and I&rsquo;m on the way of doing all the needed exams to see if we can/should fix them. Nothing critical, be reassured. 😊</p><p>In 2019 I focused a bit more on the french territory and make sure we have some presence outside Paris. And I was fortunate enough to go to cities like:</p><ul><li>Orlando, US</li><li>Mountain View, US</li><li>Singapore, SG</li><li>Moka, MU</li><li>Toronto, CA</li><li>Montreal, CA</li><li>Moscow, RU</li></ul><p>I really enjoyed being in Mountain View in December as that was my very first XSchool session. <a href=https://twitter.com/LifeAtElastic/status/932736733296279552>XSchool</a> is our way to welcome new Elasticians, introduce them to the company and our culture and its related <a href=https://www.elastic.co/about/our-source-code>Source Code</a>.</p><p>I have never been there in the past because obviously when I joined the company, we were like 15 people&mldr; No need for a &ldquo;school&rdquo; at this period of time. There I introduced what the community is about and what my team is doing and how the whole company can and should help. Our community is the key of our success.</p><h2 id=2020>2020</h2><p>I&rsquo;m trying to play with new solutions like our <a href=https://www.elastic.co/products/enterprise-search>Enterprise Search</a>. I like this use case a lot: indexing company documents and providing a clean UI to find them whatever the source is.</p><p>As the author of the <a href=https://fscrawler.readthedocs.io/>FSCrawler</a> project which has now more than <a href=https://github.com/dadoonet/fscrawler>700 stars on Github</a>, I want to <a href=https://github.com/dadoonet/fscrawler/issues/723>connect it to the Enterprise Search</a> product. This will need some refactoring and from time to time, I&rsquo;m working on that open source project.</p><p>It&rsquo;s super interesting to do it by the way because it&rsquo;s a way for me to test the <a href=https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/index.html>Elasticsearch Java Client</a> and raise issues anytime I&rsquo;m having troubles updating to the latest version.</p><p>I will still continue being on the road one week per month, still focusing on local communities and of course running the Paris meetup.</p><p>If you are reading this post and want to know more about the elastic stack and Elasticsearch specifically, please <a href=https://twitter.com/dadoonet>contact me</a> and we can work on setting up a <a href=https://www.elastic.co/blog/free-lunch-for-open-source-engineers>BBL session</a> (aka Lunch and Learn).</p><p>Happy 2020!
