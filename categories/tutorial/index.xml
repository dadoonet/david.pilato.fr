As one of those first employees I was invited (with #elkie and my wife) to the NYSE event where Elastic went listed as ESTC symbol.
Some of us there (Rashid, Karel, Myself, Igor, Costin, Luca, Clinton). Yeah. You are not probably used to see us wearing a suit! :)

Integration tests&amp;hellip; How do you run them?
Often, you are tempted to run services you want to test from JUnit for example. In elasticsearch, you can extend ESIntegTestCase class which will start a cluster of a given number of nodes.
public class BanoPluginIntegrationTest extends ESIntegTestCase { public void testPluginIsLoaded() throws Exception { // Your code here } } But to be honest, the test you are running does not guarantee that you will have the same result in production.</description></item><item><title>Creating an Ingest plugin for elasticsearch (Updated for GA)</title><link>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2016-10-17-creating-an-ingest-plugin-for-elasticsearch-updated-for-ga/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Oct 2016 10:55:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2016-10-17-creating-an-ingest-plugin-for-elasticsearch-updated-for-ga/</guid><description>NOTE: This article is an updated version of Creating an Ingest plugin for elasticsearch

I can actually use ELK stack and create a simple recipe which can be used to import SQL dump scripts without needing to actually load the data to a database and then read it again from the database.</description></item><item><title>Indexing Twitter with Logstash and Elasticsearch</title><link>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2015-06-01-indexing-twitter-with-logstash-and-elasticsearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2015 16:23:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2015-06-01-indexing-twitter-with-logstash-and-elasticsearch/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m often running some demos during conferences where we have a booth.

De plus, si vous développez une application JQuery avec un accès direct depuis le poste client à votre cluster Elasticsearch, le risque qu&amp;rsquo;un utilisateur joue un peu avec votre cluster est grand !
Alors, pas de panique&amp;hellip; La société Sonian Inc. a open sourcé son plugin Jetty pour Elasticsearch pour notre plus grand bonheur 😉</description></item><item><title>Quel client Java pour elasticsearch ?</title><link>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2012-02-13-quel-client-java-pour-elasticsearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2012 21:37:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2012-02-13-quel-client-java-pour-elasticsearch/</guid><description>Il existe deux modes d&amp;rsquo;accès à elasticsearch en Java :
Inscrire un noeud client dans le cluster elasticsearch Utiliser un client &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; Noeud client dans un cluster elasticsearch L&amp;rsquo;idée de cette méthode est de fabriquer un noeud elasticsearch (node) qui démarre avec les mêmes caractéristiques qu&amp;rsquo;un noeud d&amp;rsquo;indexation et de recherche sauf qu&amp;rsquo;on lui précise qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;hébergera pas de données.
Pour cela, on utilise la propriété suivante :
node.data=false Elle indique que le noeud que nous démarrons n&amp;rsquo;hébergera pas de données.</description></item><item><title>Elasticsearch et les "facets"</title><link>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2011-06-20-elasticsearch-et-les-facets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2011 20:34:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2011-06-20-elasticsearch-et-les-facets/</guid><description>Les aventures avec Elasticsearch se poursuivent.
Combien de fois ai-je dit récemment que ce projet est absolument génial et qu&amp;rsquo;il va constituer à mon sens un des projets majeurs des prochaines années&amp;hellip;
Qui n&amp;rsquo;a pas besoin de moteur de recherche ? Qui s&amp;rsquo;est déjà &amp;ldquo;emmerdé&amp;rdquo; à fabriquer ça lui-même ou à utiliser des briques pouvant aider au prix d&amp;rsquo;une complexité plus ou moins grande de mise en oeuvre ?
Je crois que nous sommes tous passés par là !</description></item><item><title>CouchDB</title><link>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2011-05-13-couchdb/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2011 21:08:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2011-05-13-couchdb/</guid><description>Après avoir testé Elasticsearch, me voici parti pour regarder ce monde étrange qu&amp;rsquo;on appelle le NoSQL&amp;hellip;
A dire vrai, j&amp;rsquo;ai entendu ce mot il y a quelques années, sans jamais vraiment m&amp;rsquo;y interesser&amp;hellip; Après tout, une base de données non SQL, ça n&amp;rsquo;est tout simplement pas possible !!!
Puis, à force de cotoyer le monde d&amp;rsquo;Elasticsearch et les technos JSon et REST, je me lance.
Pour des raisons très pratiques, je choisis CouchDB de Apache. D&amp;rsquo;une part, il est directement intégrable avec Elasticsearch, et à la lecture rapide de sa documentation, il semble répondre à un des besoins auquel une équipe de mon pôle de développement est confrontée.</description></item><item><title>La recherche élastique...</title><link>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2011-03-09-la-recherche-elastique/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2011 21:30:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2011-03-09-la-recherche-elastique/</guid><description>Elasticsearch, un projet mature en quelques mois&amp;hellip; A suivre de très près !
En cherchant un bout de code pour rendre la couche Hibernate Search facilement distribuable sur un cluster de machines JBoss, je suis tombé sur le projet Elasticsearch.
Au début, un peu interloqué&amp;hellip; Puis, je me lance&amp;hellip;
Je télécharge le projet. Je dézippe.
Je lance&amp;hellip;
Miracle. En quelques secondes, je dispose d&amp;rsquo;un outil dans un Cloud, simple, me permettant d&amp;rsquo;indexer n&amp;rsquo;importe quel type de document, de le récupérer et de faire une recherche (au sens google du terme) sur n&amp;rsquo;importe quel champ&amp;hellip; Et cela, quelque soit la technologie employée (Java, C#, .</description></item><item><title>Installation FusionForge 5.0 sur Redhat 5</title><link>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2010-05-11-installation-fusionforge-5-0-sur-redhat-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2010 22:23:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2010-05-11-installation-fusionforge-5-0-sur-redhat-5/</guid><description>Voici la suite de l&amp;rsquo;article sur l'installation d&amp;rsquo;une forge.
Finalement, le temps d&amp;rsquo;obtenir une machine sous Redhat 5 a laissé le temps à la team FusionForge de sortir une release finale de la version 5.0.
Nous voilà donc lancés dans cette installation que je me propose de décrire ici.
A noter que pour le moment la forge n&amp;rsquo;est pas totalement opérationnelle. Des évolutions dans la configuration devront être menées et j&amp;rsquo;espère pouvoir tenir à jour cet article pour les décrire.</description></item><item><title>Utilisation du mode Lazy d'Hibernate avec Struts et Spring</title><link>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2010-02-24-utilisation-du-mode-lazy-dhibernate-avec-struts-et-spring/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2010 13:56:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://david.pilato.fr/blog/2010-02-24-utilisation-du-mode-lazy-dhibernate-avec-struts-et-spring/</guid><description>Lorsqu&amp;rsquo;on utilise Hibernate pour déléguer la gestion de la persistence, se pose alors le classique problème de l&amp;rsquo;exception LazyInitialisationException.

Histoire d&amp;rsquo;être cohérent avec d&amp;rsquo;autres choix faits par l&amp;rsquo;administration, projet Adullact, j&amp;rsquo;ai retenu la forge GFORGE.
