Frequent speaker about all things Elastic, in conferences, for User Groups and in companies with <a href=https://www.brownbaglunch.fr/>BBL talks</a>. In my free time, I enjoy coding and <a href=http://djdadoo.pilato.fr/>DeeJaying</a>, just for fun. Living with my family in Cergy, France.</p>
<h2 id=details>Details</h2>
<p>I discovered Elasticsearch project in 2011. After contributed to the project and created open source plugins for it, David joined elastic the company in 2013 where he is Developer and Evangelist. He also created and still actively managing the French spoken language User Group. At elastic, he mainly worked on Elasticsearch source code, specifically on open-source plugins. In his free time, he likes talking about elasticsearch in conferences or in companies (<a href=https://www.elastic.co/blog/free-lunch-for-open-source-engineers>Brown Bag Lunches AKA BBLs</a>). He is also author of <a href=https://github.com/dadoonet/fscrawler>FSCrawler</a> project which helps to index your pdf, open office, whatever documents in elasticsearch using Apache Tika behind the scene.</p>

</div>
<div class=content>
What a ride! 10 employees to around 2000 now. As I imagined 8 years ago, I still think that Elasticsearch (the product) and elastic (the company) are successful.
Becoming a public company did not change a lot my daily activities.
I’m still on the road meeting/building the community, specifically in France and making sure people are sharing the same love that we have internally for the products we are building.
I’d like this year to focus this anniversary blog post on some items:

When I joined Elastic (formerly Elasticsearch) it was a startup with 10 employees + the founders. As one of those first employees I was invited (with #elkie and my wife) to the NYSE event where Elastic went listed as ESTC symbol.
Some of us there (Rashid, Karel, Myself, Igor, Costin, Luca, Clinton). Yeah. You are not probably used to see us wearing a suit! :)

Let’s say we have an existing dataset we want to enrich.

Searching for addresses Good. Can we use a search engine to search?

Importing Bano dataset with Logstash Using Logstash to lookup for addresses in Bano index Using Logstash to enrich an existing dataset with Bano I’m not really sure why, but I love the postal address use case. Often in my career I had to deal with that information. Very often the information is not well formatted so it’s hard to find the information you need when you have as an input a not so nice dataset.

In a recent post we have seen how to create real integration tests. Those tests launch a real elasticsearch cluster, then run some tests you write with JUnit or your favorite test framework then stop the cluster.
But sometimes, you may want to add existing plugins in your integration test cluster.
For example, you might want to use X-Pack to bring fantastic features such as:

Integration tests… How do you run them?
Often, you are tempted to run services you want to test from JUnit for example. In elasticsearch, you can extend ESIntegTestCase class which will start a cluster of a given number of nodes.
public class BanoPluginIntegrationTest extends ESIntegTestCase { public void testPluginIsLoaded() throws Exception { // Your code here } } But to be honest, the test you are running does not guarantee that you will have the same result in production.

Elasticsearch 5.0 switched to Gradle in October 2015.
You can obviously write a plugin using Gradle if you wish and you could benefit from all the goodies elasticsearch team wrote when it comes to integration tests and so on.
My colleague, Alexander Reelsen aka Spinscale on Twitter, wrote a super nice template if you wish to create an Ingest plugin for 5.

In a recent post we have seen how to create real integration tests. Those tests launch a real elasticsearch cluster, then run some tests you write with JUnit or your favorite test framework then stop the cluster.
But sometimes, you may want to add existing plugins in your integration test cluster.
For example, you might want to use X-Pack to bring fantastic features such as:

Integration tests… How do you run them?
Often, you are tempted to run services you want to test from JUnit for example. In elasticsearch, you can extend ESIntegTestCase class which will start a cluster of a given number of nodes.
public class BanoPluginIntegrationTest extends ESIntegTestCase { public void testPluginIsLoaded() throws Exception { // Your code here } } But to be honest, the test you are running does not guarantee that you will have the same result in production.

3 years! Can you imagine that? Already 3 years spent working at elastic? Time flies!
2015 has been an uncommon year for me.
Not because Marty Mc Fly and Doc Emmett Brown finally arrived…
Not because, Han Solo, Leia and friends were finally back again…
But for technical and also personal reasons.
On a personal side, I had to deal with two major issues which cause some slow down in my professional activities.

I gave a BBL talk recently and while chatting with attendees, one of them told me a simple use case he covered with elasticsearch: indexing metadata files on a NAS with a simple ls -lR like command. His need is to be able to search on a NAS for files when a user wants to restore a deleted file.
As you can imagine a search engine is super helpful when you have hundreds of millions files!

Some months ago, I published a recipe on how to index Twitter with Logstash and Elasticsearch.
I have the same need today as I want to monitor Twitter when we run the elastic FR meetup (join us by the way if you are in France!).
Well, this recipe can be really simplified and actually I don’t want to waste my time anymore on building and managing elasticsearch and Kibana clusters anymore.
Let’s use a Found by elastic cluster instead.

Recently, I got a database MySQL dump and I was thinking of importing it into elasticsearch.
The first idea which pops up was:
install MySQL import the database read the database with Logstash and import into elasticsearch drop the database uninstall MySQL Well. I found that some of the steps are really not needed.
I can actually use ELK stack and create a simple recipe which can be used to import SQL dump scripts without needing to actually load the data to a database and then read it again from the database.

I’m often running some demos during conferences where we have a booth. As many others, I’m using Twitter feed as my datasource.
I have been using Twitter river plugin for many years but, you know, rivers have been deprecated.
Logstash 1.5.0 provides a safer and more flexible way to deal with tweets with its twitter input.
Let’s do it!
Let’s assume that you have already elasticsearch 1.5.2, Logstash 1.5.0 and Kibana 4.0.2 running on your laptop or on a cloud instance.

</div>
<div class=content>
Sometimes, you would like to reindex your data to change your mapping or to change your index settings or to move from one server to another or to one cluster to another (think about multiple data centers for example).
For the later you can use Snapshot and Restore feature but if you need to change any index settings, you need something else.
With Logstash 1.5.0, you can now do it super easily using elasticsearch input and elasticsearch output.

Using Found by elastic cluster helps a lot to have a ready to use and managed elasticsearch cluster.
I started my own cluster yesterday to power brownbaglunch.fr website (work in progress) and it was ready to use after some clicks!
It’s a kind of magic!
But I ran into an issue when you secure it and use the elasticsearch javascript client.
Creating your cluster Found Console
Adding ACL By default, your cluster is opened but you can fix that by opening “Access Control” menu.

I gave recently a talk at Voxxed Istanbul 2015 and I’d like to share here the story of this talk.
The talk was about adding a real search engine for your legacy application. Here “legacy” means an application which is still using SQL statements to execute search requests.
Our current CRM application can visualize our customers. Each person is represented as a Person bean and have some properties like name, dateOfBirth, children, country, city and some metrics related to the number of clicks each person did on the car or food buttons on our mobile application (center of interests that is).

I was trying to use Hibernate 4.3.8.Final with Log4J2 and I spent some hours to find why Hibernate was not using Log4J2 though it was declared in my pom.xml file.
Actually, I hit issue JBLOGGING-107.
The workaround is simply to add a more recent jboss-logging dependency than the one shipped by default with Hibernate 4.3.8.Final.
&lt;dependency> &lt;groupId>org.jboss.logging&lt;/groupId> &lt;artifactId>jboss-logging&lt;/artifactId> &lt;version>3.2.1.Final&lt;/version> &lt;/dependency>

Oh wait! Already 2 years spent working for Elasticsearch? Time flies!
After the first year, I wrote that I did 58 talks in 4 countries, 37 towns for about 18 000 kilometers traveled. I was pretty sure that things would continue to grow.
This year, I spoke 78 times! Around 2 talks per week! I did around 48 000 kilometers. 8 000 km more than the earth’s circumference! I still can’t believe it… 12 countries. And no need to say that I love giving talks and sharing my enthusiasm about Elasticsearch!

I joined Elasticsearch Inc one year ago. Those were pretty exciting days!
But now…
It’s more than that! Really! You could think that after one year, my motivation would start to decrease. I have the total opposite feeling. Still excited by my job, by the company and by the project, but most of all by the amazing team I’m lucky to work with! Everyone is different and each of us adds different value to Elasticsearch. Personally, I learn a lot from my co-workers.

Once upon a time…
In fact 2 years ago, I was looking for a way to make Hibernate search distributed on multiple nodes. My first idea was to store indexes in a single database shared by my nodes. Yes, it’s a stupid idea in term of performances but I would like to try to build it.
Digging for source code, I came to the JdbcDirectory class from the compass project. And I saw on the compass front page something talking about the future of Compass and Elasticsearch.

Il était une fois…
En fait, il y a 2 ans, je cherchais un moyen pour distribuer Hibernate search sur plusieurs noeuds. Ma première idée était de stocker les index dans une base de données partagée par les différents noeuds. Oui ! Il s’agit d’une idée stupide en terme de performances, mais j’avais envie d’essayer et de construire ce modèle.
Après avoir cherché du code source, je suis finalement tombé sur la classe JdbcDirectory du projet Compass.

<div class=content>
Nativement, Elasticsearch expose l’ensemble de ses services sans aucune authentification et donc une commande du type curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/myindex peut faire de nombreux dégâts non désirés.
De plus, si vous développez une application JQuery avec un accès direct depuis le poste client à votre cluster Elasticsearch, le risque qu’un utilisateur joue un peu avec votre cluster est grand !
Alors, pas de panique… La société Sonian Inc. a open sourcé son plugin Jetty pour Elasticsearch pour notre plus grand bonheur 😉

Le besoin Il existe dans Hibernate une fonctionnalité que j’aime beaucoup : la mise à jour automatique du schéma de la base en fonction des entités manipulées.
Mon besoin est de faire quasiment la même chose avec Elasticsearch. C’est à dire que je souhaite pouvoir appliquer un mapping pour un type donné à chaque fois que je démarre mon projet (en l’occurrence une webapp).
En me basant sur le projet développé par Erez Mazor, j’ai donc développé unefactory Spring visant à démarrer des clients (voire des noeuds) Elasticsearch.

</div>
<div class=content>
Bonjour,
C’est avec une certaine émotion et fierté que j’ai appris samedi dernier la sélection de mon talk sur Elasticsearch à Devoxx France.
Devoxx France est une conférence organisée du 18 au 20 avril 2012 à Paris, pour les Développeurs. Y faire parti au milieu de talents incroyables est vraiment un honneur.
Je suis d’autant plus comblé que je vais pouvoir parler du sujet qui me passionne depuis maintenant 1 an : Elasticsearch.
A l’origine, Shay Banon devait venir lui-même nous parler de l’analyse des données avec les facettes Elasticsearch, mais il ne pourra malheureusement pas être présent.

</div>
<div class=content>
Il existe deux modes d’accès à elasticsearch en Java :
Inscrire un noeud client dans le cluster elasticsearch Utiliser un client “simple” Noeud client dans un cluster elasticsearch L’idée de cette méthode est de fabriquer un noeud elasticsearch (node) qui démarre avec les mêmes caractéristiques qu’un noeud d’indexation et de recherche sauf qu’on lui précise qu’il n’hébergera pas de données.
Pour cela, on utilise la propriété suivante :
node.data=false Elle indique que le noeud que nous démarrons n’hébergera pas de données.

</div>
<div class=content>
Il existe dans elasticsearch la notion de river (rivière) qui comme son nom le laisse supposer permet de voir s’écouler des données depuis une source jusqu’à elasticsearch.
Au fur et à mesure que les données arrivent, la rivière les transporte et les envoie à l’indexation dans elasticsearch.
En standard, il existe 4 rivières :
CouchDB qui permet d’indexer toutes les nouveautés d’une base CouchDB. Voir aussi cet article à ce propos. RabbitMQ qui permet de récupérer des documents dans une queue de traitement asynchrone (genre JMS) Twitter qui permet d’indexer votre flux de messages twitter par exemple Wikipedia qui permet d’indexer toutes les nouveautés de l’encyclopédie au fur et à mesure de leurs publications Premiers pas J’ai commencé par bidouiller un peu la rivière CouchDB pour y apporter quelques fonctionnalités dont mes collègues avaient besoin :

Les aventures avec Elasticsearch se poursuivent.
Combien de fois ai-je dit récemment que ce projet est absolument génial et qu’il va constituer à mon sens un des projets majeurs des prochaines années…
Qui n’a pas besoin de moteur de recherche ? Qui s’est déjà “emmerdé” à fabriquer ça lui-même ou à utiliser des briques pouvant aider au prix d’une complexité plus ou moins grande de mise en oeuvre ?
Je crois que nous sommes tous passés par là !

Après avoir testé Elasticsearch, me voici parti pour regarder ce monde étrange qu’on appelle le NoSQL…
A dire vrai, j’ai entendu ce mot il y a quelques années, sans jamais vraiment m’y interesser… Après tout, une base de données non SQL, ça n’est tout simplement pas possible !!!
Puis, à force de cotoyer le monde d’Elasticsearch et les technos JSon et REST, je me lance.
Pour des raisons très pratiques, je choisis CouchDB de Apache. D’une part, il est directement intégrable avec Elasticsearch, et à la lecture rapide de sa documentation, il semble répondre à un des besoins auquel une équipe de mon pôle de développement est confrontée.

Elasticsearch, un projet mature en quelques mois… A suivre de très près !
En cherchant un bout de code pour rendre la couche Hibernate Search facilement distribuable sur un cluster de machines JBoss, je suis tombé sur le projet Elasticsearch.
Au début, un peu interloqué… Puis, je me lance…
Je télécharge le projet. Je dézippe.
Je lance…
Miracle. En quelques secondes, je dispose d’un outil dans un Cloud, simple, me permettant d’indexer n’importe quel type de document, de le récupérer et de faire une recherche (au sens google du terme) sur n’importe quel champ… Et cela, quelque soit la technologie employée (Java, C#, .

Voici la suite de l’article sur l'installation d’une forge.
Finalement, le temps d’obtenir une machine sous Redhat 5 a laissé le temps à la team FusionForge de sortir une release finale de la version 5.0.
Nous voilà donc lancés dans cette installation que je me propose de décrire ici.
A noter que pour le moment la forge n’est pas totalement opérationnelle. Des évolutions dans la configuration devront être menées et j’espère pouvoir tenir à jour cet article pour les décrire.

</div>
<div class=content>
Jetty peut être très utile aux projets Maven, notamment dans la phase de tests d’intégration.
Il faut souvent déployer l’application sur un serveur type JBoss puis lancer les tests. Avec Jetty, on dispose alors d’un conteneur léger qui permet de disposer des fonctionnalités essentielles d’un conteneur (webapp, datasource, …).
Problème : avec la version 7 de Jetty, il faut gérer l’authentification. Sinon, on obtient une erreur du type :
java.lang.IllegalStateException: No LoginService for org.eclipse.jetty.security.authentication.BasicAuthenticator@4095c5ec in ConstraintSecurityHandler@28f52a14@ J’ai trouvé la solution à ce problème sur le blog de Max Berger.

</div>
<div class=content>
Lorsqu’on souhaite lancer une WebApp avec le plugin Jetty sous Maven 2 depuis un PC sous windows on obtient une erreur référencée sous JIRA #JETTY-1063 :
java.net.URISyntaxException: Illegal character in path at index 18: file:/C:/Documents and Settings/USER/.m2/repository/org/mortbay/jetty/jetty-maven-plugin/7.0.0.1beta2/jetty-maven-plugin-7.0.0.1beta2.jar Ce problème n’est résolu que sous Maven 3.
Pour ceux qui souhaitent rester sous Maven 2 (Maven 3 est encore en version alpha), il faut modifier l’emplacement de la repository pour éviter le souci du caractère ESPACE présent dans le chemin C:\Documents and settings\USER\.

</div>
<div class=content>
Lorsqu’on utilise Hibernate pour déléguer la gestion de la persistence, se pose alors le classique problème de l’exception LazyInitialisationException.
En effet, dans une modélisation assez classique, imaginons le cas suivant :
Couche Modèle (ou DAO) Classe POJO contenant un attribut x et une collection cols @Entity @Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE) public class Dossier { @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id; private String x; @OneToMany(cascade=CascadeType.ALL) private Collections cols; // Getter et setters } Classe DAO Voir le blog pour l’utilisation des generics de Java5 afin d’éviter d’avoir à coder toujours les mêmes méthodes CRUD.
